This analysis was intended to find the relation between a country's [world development indcators](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators) and their medal performance in the Olympic games.  Approximately 21 development variables were used, including GDP, GDP growth rate, birth rate, death rate, infant mortality rate, CO2 emissions, food production index, population, rural population, urban population, land area, life expectancy, and total reserves were used.  The response variable was the amount of "medal points" a country earned at each Olympic games from 1960-2014.  This analysis includes data cleaning, data imputation, data visualization, and model building.

The analysis was performed in R and can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/greyson21/801501).
